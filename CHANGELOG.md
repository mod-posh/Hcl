The HCL Parser is a custom-built C# library designed to parse, manipulate, and generate HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) files. This parser plays a crucial role in the Terraform module update process by allowing structured modifications to variables.tf, main.tf, and other HCL files. The library provides an object-oriented representation of HCL, enabling easy transformations and validation before updating Terraform modules.
